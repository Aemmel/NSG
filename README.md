# NSG

## Build
Run `cmake .` to generate a Makefile, run `make` to create an executable.

## Execute
It is important that you run the compiled program from main folder (otherwise the wrong files will be opened).
Therefore: `./bin/NSG`

## Conventions
To make indexing consistent with the math, we always index `[row][column]`
